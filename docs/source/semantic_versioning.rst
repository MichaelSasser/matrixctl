**After release "1.0.0"** this repository will use
`SemVer <https://semver.org/>`_ for its release
cycle.

.. note:: **Before release "1.0.0"** it uses "0.y.z" as recommanded by SemVer.
          This means that breaking changes result in a version change at "y"
          position (e.g. "0.1.0" -> "0.2.0"). Non breaking changes result in
          a "z" change (e.g. "0.1.1" -> "0.1.2").
