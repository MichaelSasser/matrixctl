Synapse Playbook
****************

If you want to update your `Synapse <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse>`_
instance with MatrixCtl you need to deploy them with a specific
`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ playbook.

The
`spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy <https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy>`_
project made it quite simple. To start, follow the
`link here <https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/README.md>`_.
This ansible playbook
is well documented and helps beginners, to get a fast and powerful synapse
instance with a bunch of optional "plugins" running in no time.
