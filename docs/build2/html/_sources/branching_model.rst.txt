This repository uses the
`git-flow <https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html>`_
branching model by `Vincent Driessen <https://nvie.com/about/>`_.
It has two branches with infinite lifetime:

* `master <https://github.com/MichaelSasser/matrixctl/tree/master>`_
* `develop <https://github.com/MichaelSasser/matrixctl/tree/develop>`_

The master branch gets updated on every release. The develop branch is the
merging branch.
