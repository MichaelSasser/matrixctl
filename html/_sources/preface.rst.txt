MatrixCtl is a python program to control, manage, provision and deploy our
matrix homeserver. I had a bunch of shell scripts doing that. Two weeks
after using them I couldn't remember the order in which I have to use the
arguments or which arguments where needed. It was a pain. So I decided I hack
something together fast.

It's not the most elegant piece of software I wrote, but it should do the
trick. I will continue to port the rest of the scripts and add new
features.
